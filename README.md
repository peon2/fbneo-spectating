# fbneo-spectating
A very basic first edition script for spectating https://www.fightcade.com/ games with inputs and hitboxes. 
Not all games have been tested and there seems to be an issue with some of the cps2 games.
The only script that I have written is fbneospectating.lua, with the other scripts being modified.

Special thanks to the fightcade team for adding lua functionality.

Huge thanks to Dammit (dammit9x@hotmail.com) for writing the input-display and scrolling-input-display.

I'm not sure who exactly wrote the hitboxes scripts but I found them through the mame-rr github and that's where they point to as well.
JoJo hitboxes were done by Maxie and can be found at his training mode here https://github.com/maximusmaxy/JoJoban-Training-Mode-Menu-FBNeo

Simply run fbneospectating.lua through fightcade to get the script working.

Please provide feedback.
